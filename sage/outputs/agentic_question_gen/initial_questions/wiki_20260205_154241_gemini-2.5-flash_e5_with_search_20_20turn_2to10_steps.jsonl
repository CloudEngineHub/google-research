Some CFL's fit into light fixtures formerly used for incandescent lamps and they are designed to produce the same amount of visible light found in incandescent light.

The original term \"\"non-game game\"\" was coined by late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who describes it as \"\"a form of entertainment that really doesn't have a winner, or even a real conclusion\"\". Will Wright had previously used the term \"\"software toy\"\" for the same purpose. The main difference between non-games and traditional video games is the lack of structured goals, objectives, and challenges. This allows the player a greater degree of self-expression through freeform play, since they can set up their own goals to achieve.\n<\/information>\n\n<think>\nThe search for \"Valve non-FPS games\" did not immediately give me a clear list.
