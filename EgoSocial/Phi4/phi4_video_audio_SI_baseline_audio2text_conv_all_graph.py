r"""Evaluation script for Phi-4 model with audio-to-text and graph reasoning.

This script extends the audio-to-text evaluation by incorporating a graph
representing relationships between different social cues to aid the model's
reasoning process.

To run this script, you need to have the following:
    - A Phi-4 model checkpoint.
    - A dataset with video frames, audio, and annotations.
    - A pre-computed audio-to-text transcription.
    - A graph representing relationships between social cues.

Example usage:
python phi4_video_audio_SI_baseline_audio2text_conv_all_graph.py \
    --signal graph_H --frame_num 5
